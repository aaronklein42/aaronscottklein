      <PageContent title='About Me'>My name is Aaron. I recently graduated from California University of PA with
        an A.S. Degree in Technology Studies. I live in sunny Tampa Bay, Florida, with
        my wife, two dogs, and three cats. I love the beach and the sunshine, and I
        couldn't imagine living anywhere else! I first discovered my passion for coding
        during an elective. I had no idea what to expect but it sounded interesting and 
        I quickly realized it would be my path for years to come. It's been a long road,
        but I'm finally able to say I'm a professional UI Developer!</PageContent>
