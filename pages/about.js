      <h1>About Me</h1>
      My name is Aaron. I recently graduated from California University of PA with
      an A.S. Degree in Technology Studies. I live in sunny Tampa Bay, Florida, with
      my wife, two dogs, and three cats. I love the beach and the sunshine, and I
      couldn't imagine living anywhere else!
